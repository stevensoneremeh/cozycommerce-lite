# CozyCommerce Installation

Welcome to **CozyCommerce** — a modern, high-performance ecommerce solution based on Next.js built for scalability and developer productivity.

This guide will walk you through setting up the project locally and deploying it to production using Vercel. Whether you're building an e-commerce MVP or scaling an enterprise storefront, CozyCommerce offers the tools and structure to get started quickly.

---

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following tools are installed on your machine:

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** version 19.0.0 or higher
* **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** version 10.0.0 or higher
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** for version control

We recommend using a version manager like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions easily.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

## 📦 Installation Steps

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate the Prisma client (for database access):**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Once the server is running, you can access your local store at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ☁️ Deployment on Vercel

Deploy your CozyCommerce store in minutes using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (or another supported Git provider like GitLab or Bitbucket).

2. **Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)** and click “Import Project.”

3. **Connect your Git repository**, then:

   * Select **Next.js** as the framework preset.

   * For your database, use a cloud service like [Neon](https://neon.tech) and provide the connection string in `DATABASE_URL`.

4. **Click "Deploy"** — Vercel will handle the rest, including continuous deployment on every push to your main branch.

5. After deployment, you’ll receive a Vercel-hosted URL. You can also [add a custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains) if needed.
